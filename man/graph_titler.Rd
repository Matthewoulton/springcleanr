\title{Create a Title-Case Label from a Variable Name for Graphs}
\usage{
graph_titler(var)
}
\arguments{
\item{var}{A variable name or character string. Can be passed unquoted (as a symbol) or quoted (as a string).}
}
\value{

\description{
This function converts a variable name (given as a symbol or string) into a title-cased, human-readable label
suitable for use in graph titles or axis labels. It handles common transformations such as replacing underscores,
converting to title case, preserving acronyms, formatting numeric ranges, and handling special words.
}
\details{
The function performs the following transformations:
\itemize{
\item Replaces underscores (\verb{_}) with spaces.
\item Converts to title case (e.g., "employment_rate" → "Employment Rate").
\item Preserves capitalization for common acronyms (e.g., "GDP", "UK", "UN").
\item Converts numeric ranges (e.g., "16_24" → "16–24").
\item Keeps words like "vs." and "per" in lowercase.
\item Properly formats ordinal numbers (e.g., "1st", "2nd").
}

\examples{
graph_titler(daily_award_level)
graph_titler("employment_rate_16_24")
